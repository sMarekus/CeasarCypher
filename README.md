# Caesar Cipher

A simple Python program that implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.

## Description

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

This program takes a message, a shift number, and a cipher direction (encode or decode) as inputs and performs the encryption or decryption accordingly. It supports both lowercase and uppercase letters and preserves any non-alphabetic characters in the message.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
